New stuff to practice in Hagane:

1-1
Work on new manip path. Maybe can get an even better one?
-Stay to right through most, start flipping after last bullet passes overhead in mid
-Stay left in ship phase 1, kill, the 2 enemies
-Third ship stay left then time enemy kills for more bombs
--Starts at CC2F at first ship if done right
--548e before blue flame
--7870 before first bomb
--86CD when 3rd ship appears
--8980 for 2nd bomb
--A51A for 3rd bomb


MY PATH:

At first ship, kill one enemy to advance rng enough
At second ship, RNG = 7C54. Kill first turret after bullet appears, but only one turret for blue
Immediately after, wait in lower right for double enemy spawn (one falling) and kill for double bomb
Kill last remaining enemy from ship 2 (delay so item can spawn)
On 3rd ship, Let RNG proceed 4 for bomb if got item from last enemy. Otherwise, proceed 5.
--Kill the 2 turrets after each spawns one bullet

-Hang out in left corner, kill very last guy to get to RNG = 31DD
-Divekick -> backflip in 1-2 to avoid all turtles
