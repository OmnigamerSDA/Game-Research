Prologue: First couple of fights go alright, not spectacular. Rest of the fights go fine, although biggie fight is not optimal (got hit by shade costing ~5 sec).

Sheepy Sheepy: good text, some problems with getting around. Headbutted by sheep thrice, but 3 mutton and shade fight went ok. Bought extra herb (no 3 from shades). Good siderolls. Good plains battle. Good climb.

Lost Shrine: Fights went ok, but could be better. Several missed finishers. Reasonable last fight. ~20 sec can be reasonable gained here.

Hansel & Gretel: Good dialog transition. Really really bad first phase. Probably 20 seconds to improve. Good 2nd phase. Good 3rd phase.

Aerie pt 1: Some movement problems, not more than 5 sec. Do gardener and gate gaurd quest. Got cutscene continuation. Spent a few extra seconds on setting up the Aerie skip.

Kaine & Hook: Kaine part 1 is meh. Part 2 also only ok. Hook initial phase is good. Ball phase went fine, continued into 2nd loop? Last phase went fine. Skipped the groundpounding entirely.

Boar: Fight went fine, hit by shade when collecting. Only got Boar Meat. Did not do Popola sidequest. Rescue goes only ok.

Seaside: Nothing to note here. Buy 3 M drops.

Scrap Heap: Got stuck on hill with boar. 



Review the Laboratory. Great boss fight though, got the good pattern.

Lost Shrine: Missed the root skip and bridge skip multiple times. Probably amounts to a minute lost.

Scrap Heap re 1: Got good drops. Some other small areas, and crateland could have gone better. But decent overall.

Desert: Missed bridge skip again. Could have done shopping faster. Good Roc first fight.

Roc: Missed initial double hit. Pretty good wolves and Roc fight, did not get best patterns but still did well with what he gave out.

Scrap Heap re 2: Boar travelling was good. Small movement errors cost some seconds inside. Decent fights inside.

Kalil & P33: Fight went fine, had to use s and m drops. Lost 10 sec to not finishing off Kalil right away.

Forest: Went about as expected. Smoother boar handling would be nice. Couldn't initiate text lolol. Went through text well.

Aerie re: Pathed through fine, got the small skip. Slower start to battle, but had quick transition to Wendy and got Gebuloth, and quick second skip.

Wendy: Screwed up one charge. Laser escape went well. Good bridge phase. Missed quick kill in final phase, but still fast overall. Can save ~15 sec.

Lost shrine re re: Got bridge skip on 4th try. Climb went fine. Decent triple jump. Root skip on 4th try.

Castle: Can have slightly better movement. Meh P&D fight. Ballroom went well, and had stuck shade!

Big Boar: Not the best but good enough. Armored one went ok, but not great. Camera got really confused before spiral climb. Phase 2 was so-so. Phase 3 fine as well.

D&PR2: Went very well. Destroyed them good. Battles after went ok too. 

ShadowLord: Book went down as expected. Shadowlord phase 1 went very well. Phase 2, he ran away, then ran again. Lost like 15 seconds to poor play. Final sequence went well, but 1 hit.
