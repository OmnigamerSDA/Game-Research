Rune Factory 4 Run Notes

-Opening seems mostly fine
--Skip tutorials, but otherwise must go through motions

-When to pick up rocks? Need them for ants...

-1st day is order, then also buys rice
--Buying rice can wait for a later 8 PM mission...
-Chopping on Day 4, gets exactly 20 wood
--Picks up weeds etc in addition, and about 12 rocks

-Sleep cycle begins
--Can I feasibly end earlier?
---Would have to be better than the small time benefit...

-Wake up Fall 12, 2 quests
--Start Ambrosia before gifting clorica

-Do I need boots/other side equips?

-Start right above Ambrosia after defeat
-Gift Clorica when done... about 7:30
-Get stone on FA 12... up to 40
-Plant toyherbs... are any flowers available yet?
-Clinic opens at 8 for Ambrosia scene
-Start collecting cookies

-Why don't I just buy rice when I visit Apple for cookie?
--Shopping quest available on the 12th... just do it then instead
--Get toyherbs immediately when shopping completed... can set up for beginning of day rather than later
--AH - Need to complete shopping before stone available

-Try to harvest mat stone only from larger blocks, preserve rocks

-Possible benefit from ambrosia early - quicker growing from toyherbs

-Maybe rearrange days so that first Apple visit coincides with Ambrosia KO?
--May also allow for in-season harvesting

-Recruit ants while toyherbs still growing...
--Rocks best for ants to recruit

-Fodder bin starts with 6 fodder

Additional axe chopping by FA 16 - get up to 80, matched with 40 stone

-Toyherb challenge unlocks addtl flowers, plant them as soon as finished
--Can they survive without being watered?
--Maybe do toyherb quest early, but then plant flowers in-season... need another late morning day to buy flowers
-When in ant harvesting/friending mode, can just keep can equipped and water repeatedly on the way...

-Make chem set and talk to Bado after Dylas fight and scene at clinic
--Need to also order one festival for appropriate available orders?
--Have ~9k by this point
--Found Sakuya immediately after Dylas clinic scene... bought 234

-3rd fodder run on FA 25
-Have to wait until 7 AM for final Dylas clinic scene, get cookies
--Do we even want more cookies?

-Do we need black ribbon from the mansion before Lamellar?
-KO goblins still risky... any way to minimize risk, or make lvl grind safer?
-Did 2 sets of goblins for total of 8, to get to level 
-How much do twin blades actually help in mansion? Can cut out a trip...
-Healed ants before marionnette... was it necessary? didn't really help much. They still do ~340 per hit

-Find Dolce immediately after Mansion, give moondrop (accept quest)

-Ants only need to be happiness 9 to give max lvl carapaces!

-Work out better furniture positioning for selling, crafting
--Minimize number of cat ears, since they take a lot of time to empty from inventory
--Didn't have enough to hit appropriate level... get more furs?
--Does scarf actually reduce the amount you need when crafting?
--Benefit kicks in as soon as 50...
--Just optimize order better to get through crafting faster

-Take antidote/para bottles as safety measures
-Do we stick with lemellar or get cloth shirt?
-Any good spells/skills at this point to make rooms quicker/more consistent?
--Water laser after chimera works pretty well
--Remember which rooms have barriers so you can use it early on
--Get light barrier from Delirium - does it dave time over water laser? Can I avoid overkilling too much?

-Come up with better plan for Karnak orb... does damage have to be anti-elemental? Can I always damage with non-elemental?
--Light barrier really effective vs statues and sarcophagus
--Check if doubling up on spells (R+) lets you get through the karnak orb any more efficiently...


========2nd Arc Begins=========

-Maybe look into hitting sleeping lvl 50 for HP boost?
-Anything else I can do while waiting for Doug?
--Recruit/dismiss ants? Clean inventory?

-Is wind good for Idra cave? Seems most things are earth elemental
--Idra rooms seem sloppy... lots of instances where blasted back or can't deal effectively with enemies

-Look into animal leveling... any benefit to using sprite vs continuing to level ants?

-Figure out Maya Road strats... what are they weak to? Also don't bring Sprite since she heals them

-Test throwing rocks in Maya road to trigger switches

-Can skip wolf... but is good mount
-Mystery potions battle in Sechs - optional?

-Is there other good ranged magic for leviathan?

-Damage output suffers in early floating empire...

-Any way to craft better magic equips from late-game materials?

-Plan out which magic to use in which room of Floating

-Check out final animal levels... can they do any amount of significant damage to final boss sets?
-- No they just get wrecked no matter what


THINGS TO TEST TONIGHT:

-Final boss consistency - lesser vs more armor. Assume more for now, may help reduce healing earlier
-Sakuya details - when does she disappear, and does she always have fur?
