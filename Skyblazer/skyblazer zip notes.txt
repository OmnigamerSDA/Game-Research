Skyblazer zip notes

To go up, if inside a wall and in climbing state simply punch then jump.
for standing in wall, more likely to succeed if further in.

1. b
2. -
3. y/x

holding doesn't matter, but that timing is required.

To get stuck, must hit the direction on the frame after jump in order to get stuck in. Can hold it after, but cannot hold the direction before or during jump.

If in climbing state, everything is easier.
To go left if facing left, just punch. If facing right, use magic. 2 frame window to use after jump is pressed. If used on 3rd frame, will go up instead.
