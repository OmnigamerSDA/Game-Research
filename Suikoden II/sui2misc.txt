Party to muse = party to tinto
Nanami forcefully joins
No rune/wpn open during greenhill liberation battles
In follow-up, party stays the same as for Bone Dragon
In muse, viktor joins (convoy) and you can re-select. Otherwise same as greenhill
After Kiba leaves, end up at castle entrance. Can go to Jeane?

Stallion makes Wakaba go from 1:30 to 1:00

LC Chan still in Matilda during Rockaxe stuff...? Maybe because of early visit or TP after Viki...

Damage carries over from Greenhill for Matilda quests...

Need to manually add zamza after Matilda, before Kiba

Maybe mix Shin and Zamza?

Everybody healed prior to Luca Raid

Not worth it to swap fire emblem

Is Stallion Early worth it?

Shin takes 118 dmg in Muse... but rarely gets hit. Is there a better way?

Luc will still have 1 less lvl 4 MP during worm... heal in Radat?

Blue Gate ALMOST enough to kill shin immediately... need both mag rings for guaranteed success

Takes 35 sec to get mag ring in Banner Pass

Worm crush hits center column, 60 dmg
Worm Lightning does ~188 dmg, ~80 dmg to Nanami

Can reliably kill shin after turn 1 with Open World + center placement

Open World does ~1343 to Worm

Shin does 136 damage vs Luca. Flik Thor Bolt does 612.

Vs Luca
Luc Blue Gate: 690
Riou Thor Shot: 526
Nanami: ~700

King's Road can take out soldiers following Luca

1 Wild Attack can take out luca in duel...

Nanami forcibly enters party to Muse Peace...
Stallion, Chaco have Karate Uniforms
Only some people fully healed after Luca battle... can maybe carry weak Nanami and Stallion forward for better Shin leveling?

Muse split 4 ways = lvl 43 Shin, ~146 TEC

Right after talking to Shu after Muse, go back to entrance (TP) for Koyu

Have to take Nanami. Should swap Blue Gate off Luc at some point... but need him in Muse party if want to switch off easily.

Set party after Neclord scene.

Spider slaw will deal ~2700 damage to Sierra... attack with Riou as well. Also, put some speed equips on Shin

Golem:
2706 Luc
1512 Stallion - not needed
2170 Riou
2712 Shin

40 sec to level up weapon to 13 in Tinto

1:15 for Templton

May want to include Sheena in party, since he joins anyway

Lvl 3 Fire leaves commanders alive in Greenhill forest


Bone Dragon:
Battle Oath for Berserk, maybe?
1324 - stallion
1538 - Luc
2784 - Shin
1238 - Kahn
1429 - Berserk Shin

Alternative:
1324 - Stallion
1538 - Luc
4272 - Berserk Shin
1238 - Scream

Shin leaves party after dragon, but can add him back at muse

Wolf:
650 - Luc Thor Bolt
2805 - Shin
Any phys attack

go after attacks... maybe find even more speed items?

Only take stallion to Rockaxe... maybe? Use shredding item + shredding from stallion

After Apple picks card, don't have to talk to Shu... just go back to bed

328 Str = 115 dmg to Han, 228 for wild

Fine tune seed and culgan. May need to go with mixed camps and thors

Beast Rune is really rough. Work out turn order.
