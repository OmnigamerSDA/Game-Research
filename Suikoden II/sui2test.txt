Don't need to push box all the way into corner

After Mist:

Jowy lvl 4 200 XP

~30 sec longer to do Fort Pilika Counter vs Toto Innkeep

Powering weapon up to 5 in Cornet takes ~1 min

Use Jizo as a safety net during fire lizards, muse battle

JP run gets item in right-most area of ruins... for selling later?
JP run also uses my strat for power levelling... gets there 6 min faster. Sells stuff in Muse before going to Jowston... why? Chinchirorin?
Sooooo much slop in JP run... many wrong menu choices.

Flik:
90 HP
Lvl 8 w/ 
31 def - 47, 52
50 def - 31, 35
49 atk - 20, 46*, 22, 23, 34*, 38*, 21, 20, 
40 def - 46, 
41 def - 41, 45
42 def - 43, 43

Solution:
-Don't take feathered hat in Pass, or take gauntlet etc in Forest. Load up to ~41 def and hope. Can get by with only level 3 equipment, probably

- ~15 sec to get water rune in sindar ruins

2 2 1 3 1 2 2 1 2 2

In Muse: soldier groups for Nanami, groups of 2, 3, 4. Useful to get Nanami up early, but not required (don't look for them). Can then use Tai Ho cutscene skip.

Taki: ~25 sec
Oulan: ~1 min
Templton (walking): ~1:30

Once Highlands appear, can't pass with Talisman

Flik joins briefly in SW, can take his Lightning then. Freed has on weapon, but can't remove

SDS: Nanami triggered Violence in turn 2, destroyed. Would have been 3 rd otherwise.
Abom: 2 turn without Violence; magic did 1600 + 1200

20 sec to get luc, freed y in party on the way to amada

Zamza: 30 sec
Hilda & Alex: ~45 sec
Yoshino: ~40 sec

Thoughts: Use just Unite glitch for Tinto? Think about setups and issues

Costs to get lvl2:
30+45+20+25+20+Gilbert. Stallion costs: 2:45. Gains?

15s to heal in L'Ren
Luca battle can be better optimized w/ magic. Figure out required levelling?
Stallion also as uniter in L'Ren?
dual 35s problems?

To get Adlai and back: 2:50-3:00
To get to Tai Ho: ~:30. Savings at most 1:30

Pest Rat: 1:12. 
Per cycle: 10, 10, 13.5, 11.5, 11, 13

Just enough mp on riou if have fire rune... may not need luc at all
