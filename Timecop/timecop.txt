Jump on car as it goes by, but make sure K is as far forward as possible by waiting. Then just crouch and take the hits. Adjust as needed. After second high of 3rd set sound starts, use bomb to kill third high. Then on 4th set, use crouch gun to kill low guy. Then just end at 2:28.

Stage 3-3:
Just go through to first pit, then go left. 2nd pit, go right by shooting guys. Then just keep going right until robot. Jump and kick at right at the cabinet in the background then use bomb and bullets to kill boss. Can be done at 2:55 or earlier.

Stage 4-1: 
Just run through. At tank, jump on it and then fire diagonal down to kill it.

Stage 5-1:
Can be done at about 2:39. Don't be afraid to use gun and bombs.

Stage 5-2:
Rush through, try to keep HP up. Can jump on boss. Best strat uses one damage boost (fire while moving forward) then walk to back of car, neutral stop, turn around and gun it down. About 2:28.

Stage 6-1:
If the conveyors give you a good pattern, you can outrun the screen and offscreen enemies won't spawn. Go right -> left -> left. Each transition, fall down 2 floors. 2:51 is a good time, with 2 screen scrolls.

Stage 6-2:
Go through, skip first elevator, kill turret with gun. Take second elevator, continue right. Take third elevator. For K, use guns to push him close to wall, and then use low kicks to push him the rest of the way and then use jump kicks with holding forward to kill him fastest.
